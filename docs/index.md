# Welcome to Gripa

Gripa is a python package for time series anomaly detection. The name of Gripa is taken from Scandinavian languages, which means grab or catch or seize, and not meant as Flu in Spanish :smile:.

## Why Gripa?

* **Gripa is light-weight.** Try Gripa before you build LSTM or Transformer for your time series anomaly detection.
* **Gripa is accurate.** Gripa has two available algorithms that perform very well in detecting anomalies on your time series data.
* **Gripa is comprehensive.** Gripa can detect three types of anomaly: global anomaly, contextual anomaly, and level-shift.
